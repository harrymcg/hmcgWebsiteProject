About project:
- This is a hobby project only, as I re-learn to build websites. 
- It will be a "step-up" project, where incrementally new, more difficult concepts are introduced:
    - HTML/CSS
    - Working JS (as a trial)
    - hosting onto harrymcguire.com VIA goDaddy and Azure Web Apps 
    - Implementing Angular.JS properly
