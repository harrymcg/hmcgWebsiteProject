This page lists all the handy and helpful articles I found over the course of this development phase:

1. How to set up projects
    - Setting up a basic HTML/CSS website, and JS to build a simple button: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/build-simple-website/5-javascript-basics

2. Front-end tools:
    - HEX picker for colours: https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/ (though any will do)
